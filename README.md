# Elixer AI: RAG-Enabled LLM for Automated Medical Report Analysis and Actionable Health Insights

![Project Architecure Design](Architecture.jpg)

Elixer AI is a next-generation medical diagnostics assistant built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enabled Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. Unlike traditional report viewers, Elixer AI interprets biomarkers from medical lab reports (blood, urine, sperm, stool, and pap smear) with clinical precision, providing actionable health insights, visualization, and daily biomarker tracking. The platform supports secure report uploads, multi-report monitoring, and privacy-aware diagnostics.

## ✅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lakshayysinghh/elixer-ai.git
cd elixer-ai

# Install dependencies for both client and server
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
```

### Run the Application

```bash
# In separate terminals:
cd client
npm start

cd server
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📅 Development Workflow

* **Client**: Built with React and MUI, handles UI interactions, report uploads, and chart rendering.
* **Server**: Node.js server extracts biomarker data from uploaded PDF reports and communicates with the LLM engine.
* **Cloud Integration**: Reports are stored on AWS S3, and analysis is powered by Gemini AI with RAG logic for biomarker reasoning.

---

## 🚧 Future Extensions

* 📊 AI-based medical imaging analysis (X-Ray, MRI, ECG, EEG)
* 📆 Integration with hospital systems and appointment schedulers
* 🏥 EHR system connectivity for real-time diagnostics syncing
